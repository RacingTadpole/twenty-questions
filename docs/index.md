# Learn To Program in Python

We are going to write a text game where you think of an animal,
and the program asks questions to try and guess what it is.

The program will not be a very good guesser at first, but it will learn new
animals the more you play it.

These lessons came out of teaching my 13-year-old son to program in Python,
and I hope they may be useful for you too.

Installing everything you need is probably the hardest part.
If you can do that, the lessons should be a breeze :-) .
