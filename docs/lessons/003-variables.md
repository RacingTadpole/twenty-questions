# Lesson 3: More about Variables

Let's learn one more thing before we get to loops.

Remember we had

```python
q = 'What is your name? '
x = input(q)
print('Hello ' + x + '!')
```

Programmers call `q` and `x` "variables", because they can vary.

These variables are "strings" - they contain text. (Remember programmers
call text "strings" for some reason.)

Variables can be other types of things too.

In order to do maths, you might expect numbers, and these are called "integers" (for whole numbers) and "floats" (for decimal numbers - the word "float" was picked originally because the computer stores them in a way that lets the decimal place "float" a long way to the left or right).
