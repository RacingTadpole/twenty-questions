# Lesson 2: If

What do you think this would do?

```python
print('Welcome to Twenty Questions')
print('Please think of an animal or plant, and I will try to guess what it is by asking questions.')
print('Please answer questions with "y" or "n"')
print()

x = input('Does your animal fly? ')
print('You said '+x)
if x == 'y':
    print('I think your animal is a fruit bat.')
if x == 'n':
    print('I think your animal is a wombat.')
```

Notice the colon where you might think the word "then" should be
(that's just a python thing, some other computer languages actually use "then").

And notice the indenting to show what falls under the "if".

If that's too easy, what about this one?

```python
x = input('Does your animal fly? ')
if x == 'y':
    xy = input('Is your flying animal a bird? ')
    if xy == 'y':
        print('I think your animal is a pelican.')
    if xy == 'n':
        print('I think your animal is a fruit bat.')
if x == 'n':
    print('I think your animal is a wombat.')
```

It's starting to look a bit like our game now!

It would get boring to write this out for too many more questions, right?

Wouldn't it be nice to put this in a loop somehow?
