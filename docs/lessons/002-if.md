# Lesson 2: If

What do you think this would do?

```python
print('Welcome to Twenty Questions')
print('Please think of an animal or plant, and I will try to guess what it is by asking questions.')
print('Please answer questions with "yes" or "no')
print()

x = input('Does your animal fly? ')
print('You said: ' + x)

if x == 'yes':
    print('Great!')
    print('I think your animal is a fruit bat.')
if x == 'no':
    print('Aha!')
    print('I think your animal is a wombat.')
```

Notice the double equals signs `==` that "if" uses to check if `x` equals `'yes'`.
Programmers use a double equals sign to ask a question about whether
the two things are equal. (Does `x` equal `'yes'`?)

In contrast, the single equals sign in `x = input('Does your animal fly? ')`
actually _changes_ `x` to "make it equal to" what the person types in.

Also notice instead of saying "then", there's a colon, and the stuff after it
has been indented.

If that's too easy, what about this one?

```python
x = input('Does your animal fly? ')
if x == 'yes':
    xy = input('Is your flying animal a bird? ')
    if xy == 'yes':
        print('I think your animal is a pelican.')
    if xy == 'no':
        print('I think your animal is a fruit bat.')
if x == 'no':
    print('I think your animal is a wombat.')
```

It's starting to look a bit like our game now!

It would get boring to write this out for too many more questions, right?

Wouldn't it be nice to put this in a loop somehow?
