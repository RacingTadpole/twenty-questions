Remember we had q = 'What is your name? ' x = input(q) print('Hello ' + x + '!') Programmers call q and x \"variables\", because they can vary. String variables These particular variables are \"strings\" - they contain text. (Remember programmers call text \"strings\" for some reason.) Variables can be other types of things too. Numeric variables In order to do maths, you might expect numbers, and these are called \"integers\" (for whole numbers) or \"floats\" (for decimal numbers - the word \"float\" was picked originally because the computer stores them in a way that lets the decimal place \"float\" a long way to the left or right). n = 10 print(n) print(n + 5) print(n / 2) print(n * 3) k = n * 3 + 1 print(k) x = k / 10 print(x) Etc. You can ask if a variable is a string ( str ), an integer ( int ) or a float ( float ) using isinstance like this: n = 10 print(isinstance(n, int)) print(isinstance(n, str)) which returns True or False . In fact these responses are another type of variable, which can only be True or False. Such variables are named \"boolean\" ( bool ) after George Boole, an 1800s mathematician, for some reason, although the idea of true and false must be older than that. True/False variables a = True print(a) x = 'yes' print(x == 'yes') Notice the double equals sign gives us a True or False too. If you think about it, that makes sense for using with \"if\", right? If something is true, do something; if it's false, do something else. Lists Let's talk about one more, fancier type of variable - a list, eg. x = [1, 3, 4, 7, 'hello'] print(x) print(x[1]) print(len(x)) This will be handy in our next lesson, on loops. Notice how we got an element out of the list with x[1] - was it the one you expected? (Python starts counting at 0!) - and the length of the list with len(x) (the length is still what you'd expect, fortunately). Do you think you can put a list inside a list?

Idea 1: For So, we want to put it in a loop somehow. Let's start with a for loop - what would this do? questions = [ 'Is it blue?', 'Is it bigger than a football?', 'Is it a mammal?', 'Does it fly?', ] for question in questions: x = input(question + ' ') print('Thanks for playing.') It asks all the questions ok, but it asks them all and ignores the answers! Idea 2: While This looks like a job for a while loop. With the same questions as above, let's try: i = 0 while i < len(questions): x = input(questions[i] + ' ') if x == 'n': i = i + 1 if x == 'y': i = i + 2 Now the questions depend on the answers - but not in a very sensible way. Idea 3: List of lists What we need is, for each question, a way to say which question comes next when you answer no, and which question comes next when you answer yes. Here's an idea: for each question, replace it with the question, its number, and the question numbers to go to when you answer yes and no. data = [ [0, 'Does your animal fly?', 1, 2], [1, 'Is your flying animal a bird?', 3, 4], [2, 'Does your animal live underwater?', 7, 8], [3, 'Is your bird native to Australia?', 5, 6], [4, 'Is it a fruit bat?'], [5, 'Is it a kookaburra?'], [6, 'Is it a blue jay?'], [7, 'Is your animal a mammal?', 9, 10], [8, 'Is it a wombat?'], [9, 'Is it a blue whale?'], [10, 'Is it a goldfish?'], ] See if you can trace through in your mind how the questions and answers are linked. It's just like a choose your own adventure! Notice what we did when there are no more questions to ask - we just left off the last two numbers. If you say yes, the animal does fly (question number 0), then you are asked if it's a bird (question number 1); if you say no to that, you are asked \"is it a fruit bat?\" (number 4) - and there are no more questions after that.
